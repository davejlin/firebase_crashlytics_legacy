For help migrating to this release please see the [migration guide](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/migration).

* **BREAKING**: Removal of Fabric SDKs and migration to the new Firebase Crashlytics SDK.
* **BREAKING**: The following methods have been removed as they are no longer available on the Firebase Crashlytics SDK:
  * `setUserEmail`
  * `setUserName`
  * `getVersion`
  * `isDebuggable`
* **BREAKING**: `log` now returns a Future. Calling `log` now sends logs immediately to the underlying Crashlytics SDK instead of pooling them in Dart.
* **BREAKING**: the methods `setInt`, `setDouble`, `setString` and `setBool` have been replaced by `setCustomKey`.
  * `setCustomKey` returns a Future. Calling `setCustomKey` now sends custom keys immediately to the underlying Crashlytics SDK instead of pooling them in Dart.
* **DEPRECATED**: `enableInDevMode` has been deprecated, use `isCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled` and `setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled` instead.
* **DEPRECATED**: `Crashlytics` has been deprecated, use `FirebaseCrashlytics` instead.
* **NEW**: Custom keys that are automatically added by FlutterFire when calling `reportError` are now prefixed with `flutter_error_`.
* **NEW**: Calling `.crash()` on Android  & iOS/macOS now reports a custom named exception to the Firebase Console. This allows you to easily locate test crashes.
  * Name: `FirebaseCrashlyticsTestCrash`.
  * Message: `This is a test crash caused by calling .crash() in Dart.`.
* **NEW**: `recordError` now uses a named native exception when reporting to the Firebase Console. This allows you to easily locate errors originating from Flutter.
  * Name: `FlutterError`.
* **NEW**: Added support for `checkForUnsentReports`.
  * Checks a device for any fatal or non-fatal crash reports that haven't yet been sent to Crashlytics.
  * See reference API docs for more information.
* **NEW**: Added support for `deleteUnsentReports`.
  * If automatic data collection is disabled, this method queues up all the reports on a device for deletion.
  * See reference API docs for more information.
* **NEW**: Added support for `didCrashOnPreviousExecution`.
  * Checks whether the app crashed on its previous run.
  * See reference API docs for more information.
* **NEW**: Added support for `sendUnsentReports`.
  * If automatic data collection is disabled, this method queues up all the reports on a device to send to Crashlytics.
  * See reference API docs for more information.
* **NEW**: Added support for `setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled`.
  * Enables/disables automatic data collection by Crashlytics.
  * See reference API docs for more information.
* **NEW**: Added support for `isCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled`.
  * Whether the current Crashlytics instance is collecting reports. If false, then no crash reporting data is sent to Firebase.
  * See reference API docs for more information.
* **FIX**: Fixed a bug that prevented keys from being set on iOS devices.
